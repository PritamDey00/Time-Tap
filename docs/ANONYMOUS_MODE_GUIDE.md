# 🕶️ Anonymous Mode User Guide

## Overview

Anonymous Mode is a privacy feature that allows users to participate in classroom activities while hiding their identity in leaderboards. This feature helps maintain privacy while still allowing full participation in the learning environment.

## 🎯 What Anonymous Mode Does

### ✅ What Changes When Anonymous:
- **Leaderboard Display**: Your name appears as "Anonymous User #X" in leaderboards
- **Privacy Protection**: Your real name is hidden from other users in rankings
- **Points Tracking**: Your points and streak are still tracked normally
- **Full Functionality**: All features work exactly the same

### ❌ What Stays the Same:
- **Custom Classrooms**: Your real name still shows in custom classroom participation
- **Chat Messages**: Your name appears normally in chat (anonymous mode doesn't affect chat)
- **Account Settings**: Your profile and settings remain unchanged
- **Progress Tracking**: All your progress, points, and streaks are maintained

## 🚀 How to Use Anonymous Mode

### Enabling Anonymous Mode:
1. **Navigate to Dashboard**: Go to your main dashboard/Universal Classroom
2. **Find Toggle**: Look for the "Anonymous Mode" toggle switch
3. **Click to Enable**: Click the toggle to turn on anonymous mode
4. **Confirmation**: The toggle will show as enabled (usually highlighted or checked)

### Disabling Anonymous Mode:
1. **Find Toggle**: Locate the same "Anonymous Mode" toggle
2. **Click to Disable**: Click the toggle again to turn off anonymous mode
3. **Return to Normal**: Your real name will appear in leaderboards again

## 🎭 Anonymous Display

### In Leaderboards:
- **Universal Classroom**: Shows as "Anonymous User #123" (with unique number)
- **Custom Classrooms**: Shows your real name (anonymous mode doesn't apply)
- **Ranking Position**: Your position in rankings is still accurate
- **Points Display**: Your actual points are shown

### Anonymous Identifier:
- Each anonymous user gets a unique number (e.g., "Anonymous User #456")
- This number stays consistent while you remain anonymous
- Other users can still see there's a participant, just not who it is

## 🔧 Technical Details

### How It Works:
- **Client-Side Toggle**: The toggle immediately updates your anonymous status
- **Server Synchronization**: Your preference is saved and applied to leaderboard displays
- **Real-Time Updates**: Leaderboards update immediately when you toggle the mode
- **Session Persistence**: Your anonymous mode preference is remembered across sessions

### Privacy Considerations:
- **Limited Scope**: Only affects leaderboard display, not other interactions
- **Custom Classrooms**: Your identity is still visible in custom classroom contexts
- **Chat Participation**: Chat messages still show your real name
- **Admin Visibility**: Classroom administrators can still see participant lists

## 🎯 Use Cases

### When to Use Anonymous Mode:
- **Privacy Concerns**: When you prefer not to show your name in public rankings
- **Competitive Pressure**: To reduce social pressure from visible rankings
- **Focus on Learning**: To concentrate on personal progress rather than comparisons
- **Temporary Privacy**: For specific study sessions where you want anonymity

### When NOT to Use Anonymous Mode:
- **Custom Classrooms**: Where instructor needs to track individual participation
- **Team Activities**: Where identification is important for collaboration
- **Assessment Periods**: When instructors need to monitor individual progress
- **Social Learning**: When you want recognition for your achievements

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### Toggle Not Working:
- **Refresh Page**: Try refreshing the browser page
- **Check Connection**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection
- **Clear Cache**: Clear browser cache and cookies if issues persist
- **Try Different Browser**: Test in a different browser to isolate issues

#### Still Showing Real Name:
- **Check Toggle State**: Verify the toggle is actually enabled (highlighted/checked)
- **Wait for Update**: Leaderboards may take a few seconds to update
- **Custom Classroom**: Remember anonymous mode doesn't apply to custom classrooms
- **Refresh Leaderboard**: Try refreshing the page to force leaderboard update

#### Anonymous Number Changed:
- **Expected Behavior**: Anonymous numbers may change between sessions
- **Consistent Within Session**: Number should stay the same during a single session
- **No Impact on Function**: Different numbers don't affect your points or progress

### Getting Help:
If anonymous mode isn't working properly:
1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any error messages (F12 → Console)
2. **Test in Incognito**: Try using anonymous mode in an incognito/private window
3. **Contact Support**: Report the issue with details about when it occurs
4. **Temporary Workaround**: You can still participate normally even if toggle doesn't work

## 🎓 Best Practices

### Effective Use:
- **Consistent Choice**: Decide whether you want to be anonymous for a study session and stick with it
- **Understand Limitations**: Remember it only affects leaderboards, not all interactions
- **Custom Classroom Awareness**: Know that your name will still show in custom classrooms
- **Regular Participation**: Anonymous mode doesn't affect your ability to earn points and maintain streaks

### Privacy Tips:
- **Review Settings**: Regularly check your anonymous mode status
